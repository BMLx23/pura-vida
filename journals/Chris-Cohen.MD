* Worked on resolving the issues that I have with Docker on my desktop PC (Have mac as backup)
* Messed around with gitlab issues and merge requests to learn more about them
* Worked on The new tables in our project
* Studied Postgresql documentation to be better prepared for the future of the project.

* I realized today how to limit length of things in sql

## 10/9-12

* Basically just worked on endpoints the whole time. Feeling really good about them. No major blockers.

* Throughout the week it got easier and easier to do.
