    today we put a pause on endpoint work to switch and work on backend authentication
     we made it most of the way through the video working through when we called it as day
     we will continue our work on auth tomorrow

    started working on backend endpoints for users
    while also having each group member create their own branch for ease of adding our journals for the overview
    changed our method of creating issues and branches for better cleanliness of code

27 sept
    started writing my development journals for better track of progress through the project,
    completed remaining tables and got more commits in

26 sept
    today we created a table and tested its functionality using beekeeper,
    we practiced commits and merges after adding psycopg to our requirements.tx file
    and discussed some future plans for the nest few days
