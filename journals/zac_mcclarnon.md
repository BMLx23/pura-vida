17 oct
    so today i had to fix a syntax error with my migration table work i did yesterday
    i verified some of my teammates work and merged them with main
    i started on my frontend review form hitting a few roadblocks of confusion im attempting to work through

16 oct
    we started on front end today discussing what needs to be done first to proceed
    i went back and added a on delete cascade to our foreign keys on the migration tables

12 oct
    today i finished the review endpoints by creating a delete endpoint for reviews
    we started collaborating on the final endpoints to get them all completed so we can move forward to the frontend as a whole

11 oct
    group continued working on backend endpoints
    i created a post endpoint with auth for reviews
    i created a get all endpoint and added a get all reviews by post to the endpoint

10 oct
    we completed backend auth working through any blockers that arose
    we are starting to build protected backend endpoints

9 oct
    today we put a pause on endpoint work to switch and work on backend authentication
     we made it most of the way through the video working through when we called it as day
     we will continue our work on auth tomorrow

28 sept
    started working on backend endpoints for users
    while also having each group member create their own branch for ease of adding our journals for the overview
    changed our method of creating issues and branches for better cleanliness of code

27 sept
    started writing my development journals for better track of progress through the project,
    completed remaining tables and got more commits in

26 sept
    today we created a table and tested its functionality using beekeeper,
    we practiced commits and merges after adding psycopg to our requirements.tx file
    and discussed some future plans for the nest few days
